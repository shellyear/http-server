# HTTP

- HTTP is an application-layer protocol that defines how messages should be formatted.
- It relies on TCP (a transport-layer protocol) to handle the actual data transmission.
- When an HTTP request or response is sent, itâ€™s just a formatted text string that gets transmitted over a TCP connection.
- A real HTTP server should handle request parsing, different HTTP methods (GET, POST), headers, and more.
