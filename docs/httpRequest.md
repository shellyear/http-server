# HTTP request

- An HTTP request is made up of three parts, each separated by a CRLF (\r\n):

1. Request line.
2. Zero or more headers, each ending with a CRLF.
3. Optional request body.

- Here's an example of an HTTP request:

```js
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost:4221\r\nUser-Agent: curl/7.64.1\r\nAccept: */*\r\n\r\n
```

- Here's a breakdown of the request:

```js
// Request line
GET                          // HTTP method
/index.html                  // Request target
HTTP/1.1                     // HTTP version
\r\n                         // CRLF that marks the end of the request line

// Headers
Host: localhost:4221\r\n     // Header that specifies the server's host and port
User-Agent: curl/7.64.1\r\n  // Header that describes the client's user agent
Accept: */*\r\n              // Header that specifies which media types the client can accept
\r\n                         // CRLF that marks the end of the headers

// Request body (empty)
```
